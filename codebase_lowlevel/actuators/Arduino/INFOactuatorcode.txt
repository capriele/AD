esc_control_by_serial_or_receiver_using_servo_library_100Hz

required change in Servo.h!



best so far:
esc_control_by_serial_or_receiver_using_rcarduinofastlib

doesnt seem to work beyond 100hz. jitter of 5us

also good, but uses int0 and int1-pins:
esc_control_by_serial_or_receiver_using_servo_lib)100hz

interrupt on receiver-channel8-flag disturbs pulseln-reading, but that might be ok as cleaness and accuray of jetson-pwm is more important!
