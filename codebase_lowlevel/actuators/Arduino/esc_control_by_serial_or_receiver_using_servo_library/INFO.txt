this brings down reading of the 400Hz flight controller output to 50Hz (waiting and reading all 4 channels sequentially with pulseln, outputs a ~50Hz PWM (Servolib) and has up to >30ms delay (first motor read, then 3 others 3x2.5ms (400hz) + 2+20ms potential delay in switch-flag reading) of a motor pwm pulse (I think, derived from blocking code)

motor 1has has at least 10-ms delay (4 pulseln before writeCommand
